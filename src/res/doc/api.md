# The API

* you are not limited to this API.

## Most used functions and variables: The orm64 table

The first function you will learn from this documententation is the *amazing* the *indestructible* the amazing: `orm64.get_software_path`.

This function returns the path of a specified software.

If the path does NOT exist, it returns nil.

Be sure to use nil-checking before using the result from the function so no bugs appear in your program.

## The Graphics and Multimedia APIs

The whole reason I made Orm64 was to make a simple game console that runs on your computer.

So of course we need graphics and multimedia.

Unless you want to make graphics from scratch using the CPU, you should use this API for graphics.
