# orm64

A simple, lua-based, fantasy operating system.

It's kinda like those fantasy game consoles, except its meant to be an enitre OS.

Here is the [wiki](https://gitlab.com/IamPyu/orm64/-/wikis/home).

## Update March 9th 2024

The term "fantasy console" or "fantasy operating system" for Orm64 does not make sense.

Instead Orm64 will be labelled as "an API layer for creating Software with Lua.".

Which makes features like "Users" useless and bloated, *which is good (Just kidding!)*.

## Other stuff

This project **probably** has a bunch of crappy code.
But don't blame me it's my first big C/C++ project in 2 years.
